(DONE) *Java doc

(FIXED) * "by U2" is displayed without a song title (this is the only song that does this)

(FIXED)* Clicking a "sort" method before displaying by hobby/major/region causes an error.

(FIXED)*Glyph goes off-screen

(FIXED)* Need to disable previous/next at appropriate times. This is the checkButtons() method but it does not currently work properly.

*The black bar in the glyphs should be a little skinnier (I can take care of this).

(FIXED)*Keys are wrong. Here are the correct keys (keeping colors in same order):

Reading
Art
Sports
Music

Computer Science
Other Eng
Math or CMDA
Other

Northeast US
Southeast US

Outside US

(FIXED)*Before any text is opened, little yellow bars are seen near the key that shouldn't be there.
