(Please do everything possible on the window to look for bugs and add them here if you find any)

IMPORTANT (non-design-related bugs)
__________
* "by U2" is displayed without a song title (this is the only song that does this)
(FIXED)* Need to disable previous/next at appropriate times. This is the checkButtons() method but it does not currently work properly.

DESIGN ISSUES
__________
*Window is too small (possibly, not completely sure on this. Just test a bunch of random things and see if anything goes off the window.
We could expand the window because the key is going off it, or we could recenter the key).
(FIXED)*Keys are wrong. Here are the correct keys (keeping colors in same order):

Reading
Art
Sports
Music

Computer Science
Other Eng
Math or CMDA
Other

Northeast US
Southeast US
Other US
Outside US

*Before any text is opened, little yellow bars are seen near the key that shouldn't be there.
*The black bar in the glyphs should be a little skinnier (I can take care of this).
